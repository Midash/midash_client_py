# Midas Dashboard Client (Python)

This is a python client-side code for the Midas Dashboard project: http://midash.net/

While server-side code is kept private, we're interested in making it transparent what information we get from your PC and what the client can do. 

So, if you don't trust our compiled client, you can check out it's code here, or use it as a python script or build it yourself. Or even create your own client version, if you so desire.
